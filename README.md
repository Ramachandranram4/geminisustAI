SustAInxt 🌱🚨
AI-Powered Sustainable Urban Emergency Intelligence Platform

Built entirely using Google Gemini 3

📌 Overview

SustAInxt is an end-to-end AI-powered emergency intelligence platform designed to help smart cities detect, analyze, and respond to urban incidents in real time.
Using Google Gemini 3 as the sole AI foundation, SustAInxt transforms citizen-reported images and videos into actionable emergency intelligence, enabling faster, more sustainable, and multilingual responses.

The platform aligns with UN SDG-11 (Sustainable Cities & Communities) by optimizing emergency response, reducing resource wastage, and improving urban resilience.

💡 Inspiration

Food deliveries reach doorsteps in minutes — but emergency responses still rely on slow, manual workflows.
We asked a simple question:

“If logistics can be optimized in minutes, why not emergency response?”

SustAInxt was inspired by this gap and built to ensure faster, smarter, and more sustainable emergency coordination, especially in densely populated cities.

🎯 What It Does

Detects real-world incidents (fire, flood, accidents, hazards) from images/videos

Assesses severity using AI reasoning

Provides situational awareness and safety guidance

Automatically adapts responses to regional languages

Visualizes incidents on live maps

Dispatches AI-generated alerts to emergency authorities

All of this is achieved using Gemini 3 multimodal intelligence.

🛠️ How We Built It (Gemini 3–Only)

SustAInxt is built with a single, unified AI stack:

Gemini 3 Vision → Incident detection & severity analysis

Gemini 3 Multimodal Reasoning → Context + GPS + risk understanding

Gemini 3 Language Intelligence → Precautions, explanations, translations

Gemini 3 TTS → AI voice alerts for authorities

Google Genkit → Orchestration of all Gemini workflows

No third-party AI models were used.
